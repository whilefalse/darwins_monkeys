Whats in a name That which we call a rose
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
The lady doth protest too much
If music be the food of love play on
All the worlds a stage
To be or not to be
There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio
To sleep perchance to dream
O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
Such stuff as dreams are made on
Parting is such sweet sorrow
The winter of our discontent
What a piece of work is a man
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
Out damned spot
The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars
Prodigious birth
All that glisters is not gold
Et tu Brute
Cowards die many times before their deaths
The plays the thing
Frailty thy name is woman
What light through yonder window breaks
My words fly up my thoughts remain below
The course of true love never did run smooth
Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears
Nothing can come of nothing
Alas poor Yorick
We should be wood and were not made to woo
The quality of mercy is not strained
A plague on both your houses
Blow blow thou winter wind
Beware the ides of March
Fortunes fool
So wise so young they say do never live long
Method in the madness
O how this spring of love resembleth
O happy dagger
We that are true lovers run into
The worlds mine oyster
A lean and hungry look
Off with his head
Hath not a Jew eyes
How now A rat Dead for a ducat dead
Done to death by slanderous tongue
Why then tonight let us assay our plot
Thou art a votary to fond desire
Some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps
Be not afraid of greatness
Lord what fools these mortals be
Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
I go and it is done the bell invites me
I follow him to serve my turn upon him
Is this a dagger which I see before me
I am dying Egypt dying
Come lets away to prison We two alone will sing
Get thee to a nunnery
Let every eye negotiate for itself
One that loved not wisely but too well
More matter with less art
Oft expectation fails and most oft there
A horse a horse My kingdom for a horse
And thus I clothe my naked villany
Eye of newt and toe of frog
All the infections that the sun sucks up
Give me my robe put on my crown
Journeys end in lovers meeting
When shall we three meet again
This thing of darkness
Asses are made to bear and so are you
Think you I am no stronger than my sex
I am constant as the northern star
O coward conscience how dost thou afflict me
O what men dare do
That man that hath a tongue I say is no man
Is whispering nothing
Heres ado to lock up honesty
Now go we in content
The noblest Roman of them all
O villain villain smiling damned villain
The man that hath no music in himself
When beggars die there are no comets seen
The greeneyed monster
O true apothecary
The most unkindest cut of all
I will buy with you sell with you talk with you
How poor are they that have not patience
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua
What my dear Lady Disdain Are you yet living
I hold the world but as the world Gratiano
Whats gone and whats past help
Was ever woman in this humour wood
When you do dance I wish you
The beall and the endall
An improbable fiction
An itching palm
Antic disposition
To beggar description
Bated breath
